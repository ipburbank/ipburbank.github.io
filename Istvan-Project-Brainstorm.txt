* Abstract
The proposal is to create a "game" which is publically available with the primary purpose of exploring human input into evolutionary processes. Modes of input might include fitness evaluation and/or providing an entrant to tournament-based selection.

* Input Medium
+ Web-based
+ Usable by a general audience
+ Exciting
+ Competition between entrants?

* Game Modes
** Option 1: Fitness Evaluation
Similar to Endless Forms - users are presented with several mutations and choose several that they think are most fit.
*** TODO Outcomes
+ Paper on:

*** Technical Components
+ Based front-end off of Endless Forms: Update option-display JS and leaderboards
+ Develop game simulator. Likely based on existing soft-robot software.
+ Evolution is on the server.
+ Develop algorithms.

** Option 2: Tournament Entrant
Users design a "robot" through a simple interface that competes against a computer-generated "robot". A round-based game encourages incremental improvement in the user's and computer's robot.
*** Outcomes
+ Comparison of human vs. computer and computer vs. computer coevolution
  + Comparison of features that develop
  + Comparison of improvement rate (by time and number of generations)
+ Find approaches to "train" a geneticly-designed robot for a practical task
*** Technical Components
+ UI likely needs to be completely re-written
+ Develop in-browser robot designer
+ Develop game simulator (as before)
+ Develop algorithms (as before)
+ If not all simulation is done in-browser, develop server-side evolution. Likely re-using some Endless Forms code.

* Game Ideas
+ Arm wrestle :: Human and computer enter soft robots that compete in arm wrestling matches.
+ Battle Bots :: Build some sort of fighting robots
