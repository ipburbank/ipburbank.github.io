* Abstract
The proposal is to create a "game" which is publically available with the primary purpose of exploring human input into evolutionary processes. Modes of input might include fitness evaluation and/or providing an entrant to tournament-based selection.

* Input Medium
+ Web-based
+ Usable by a general audience
+ Exciting
+ Competition between entrants?

* Game Modes
** Fitness Evaluation
Similar to Endless Forms - users are presented with several mutations and choose several that they think are most fit.
*** TODO Outcomes
+ Paper on: 

** Tournament Entrant
Users design a "robot" through a simple interface that competes against a computer-generated "robot". A round-based game encourages incremental improvement in the user's and computer's robot.
*** Outcomes
+ Comparison of human vs. computer and computer vs. computer coevolution
  + Comparison of features that develop
  + Comparison of improvement rate (by time and number of generations)
+ Approaches to "train" a geneticly-designed robot for a practical task

* Game Ideas
+ Arm wrestle :: Human and computer enter soft robots that compete in arm wrestling matches.
+ Battle Bots :: Build some sort of fighting robots
